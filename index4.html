<p class="sisi">Manchester United Football Club, commonly referred to as Man United  or simply United, is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top division in the English football league system. Nicknamed the Red Devils, they were founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, but changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. After a spell playing in Clayton, Manchester, the club moved to their current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.

Domestically, Manchester United have won a record 20 league titles, 12 FA Cups, six League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. In international football, they have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, 10 years after eight of the club's players were killed in the Munich air disaster, they became the first English club to win the European Cup.

<h4> Biggest Rivalry </h4>
<div class="con">
    <div class="text">
<p class="sisi"> 
Among the top Premier League teams, Liverpool FC represents Manchester United's oldest and biggest rival for both geographical and historical reasons. The two cities, which are the largest in North West England and the main industrial centers in the country, are only thirty-five miles apart from each other. Furthermore, the two clubs were the most successful ones in the decades before the creation of the English Premier League.
These clubs have been fighting each other both domestically and internationally for decades.
However, this rivalry has seen some dark episodes as both teams' fan groups have jawed at each other over the years. While their matchups have been extremely competitive, Liverpool has been victorious more frequently than Manchester United in this rivalry.

<h6> Records </h6>
<div class="con">
    <div class="text">
        <p class="yy"> Manchester United became the first team to win the English Premier League in 1992. This win was possible because they had a more talented squad, and Alex Ferguson had just recently taken the club’s reins.On May 28th 1968, Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup, defeating Benfica 4-1 at Wembley Stadium in London. Manchester United is the most dominant club in England, having won the Premier League a record 13 times, and this record is seven more titles than the other closest team. The Red Devils have been known for their attacking style of play, with players such as Bobby Charlton, Denis Law, George Best and Eric Cantona all over their trophy case.The club has won 20 titles since 1889, holding a record no other team has yet to break. Manchester United have won the FA Cup the most (11 times) and appeared in the most finals (18 times), both shared with their top rival Arsenal.Red Devils take pride in having Alex Ferguson, the Premier League’s longest-tenured manager. Manchester United has one of the greatest football stories of all time, and we are far from seeing its final chapter.
